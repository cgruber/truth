## Planned improvements and changes

  - Subject wrappers for new types:
    - Support for Protocol Buffers (and other reflective types)
    - Support for Java8 types (Optional, Stream, etc.)
    - Cleaned up API for extending Truth via failure strategies, supplementary context.
    - Code-generated boilerplate for custom subjects
    - Iterating subjects (code-generated for each Subject), e.g.
      ```java
      assertAbout(strings()).in(collection).thatEach().contains("foo");
      ```

## 1.0-SNAPSHOT

  - Basic form of:
    - `verb().that(subject).somePredicate();`
  - Shorthand for `assert_().that(...)...` as `assertThat(...)...`
  - Support for different "failure strategies":
    - Assertions: Immediate short-circuited failure
    - Assumptions: Skipping the test as invalid (useful in parameterized tests)
    - Expectations: Error at end of test, gathering failures for later reporting.
    - Mechanism for supplying other behavior on failure. 
  - Strongly typed proposition classes (Subject wrapper classes) including support for
    - Arbitrary objects
    - Strings
    - Collections: Iterators, Collections, and Lists, Maps
    - Arrays: Object, primitives (boolean, int, float, etc.)
    - Class objects
    - Booleans
    - Integral types
    - Floating point types (with proper delta/tolerance-aware comparisons)
    - Guava Optional<T> and other Guava types
      (java8 `Optional<T>` will be provided through an extension)
    - And [many other types](known_types)
  - Extensibility via `about`, e.g. `assertAbout(javaSources()).that(sourceFile)...`
  - Labeling of subjects without reasonable toString() implementations via `named("label")`
  - Providing a contextual failure message via `assertWithMessage("someMessage").that(...)...`
  - ComparisonFailure used for Strings (for better IDE errors)
