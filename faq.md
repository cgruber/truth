## What if I have an import conflict with another `assertThat()` method? {#imports}

We recommend static importing Truth's `assertThat()` shortcut method. However,
if that causes an ambiguous method conflict, you can use the longhand form:
`assert_().that()`. The following statements are identical:

```java
import static com.google.common.truth.Truth.assertThat;
import static com.google.common.truth.Truth.assert_;
...
String string = "google";
assertThat(string).endsWith("gle");
assert_().that(string).endsWith("gle");
```

## When writing my own Truth extension, how should I name my assertion methods? {#assertion-naming}

*   If you're checking a property (e.g., `name`), use a `has` prefix (e.g.,
    `hasName(String name)`).
*   If you're testing a state (e.g., `isCeo`), use a `is` prefix (e.g.,
    `isCeo()` and `isNotCeo()`). Alternatively, you may wish to provide a single
    `isCeo(boolean isCeo)` method instead of writing two methods (however, this
    will generally make your statements slightly less readable).
*   If you're returning a new subject for a property of the instance under test,
    do not use a prefix (e.g., use `name()` for a method on `EmployeeSubject`
    that returns a `StringSubject`:
    `assertThat(employee).name().startsWith(...)`).
*   **When in doubt, prefer method names that make the assertion statements
    "sound natural".**

## What's the difference between `containsAll` and `containsExactly` for iterables? {#exactly}

`containsAll` means the iterable contains all of the expected elements.

`containsExactly` means the iterable contains all of the expected elements __and
nothing else__.

For example:

```java
ImmutableList<String> abc = ImmutableList.of("a", "b", "c");

assertThat(abc).containsAllOf("a", "b", "c");   // passes
assertThat(abc).containsExactly("a", "b", "c"); // passes

assertThat(abc).containsAllOf("a", "b");        // passes
assertThat(abc).containsExactly("a", "b");      // fails
```

Also note that both of the methods are *order-independent assertions*. If you
want order to be checked, you must chain `.inOrder()` onto the end of your
assertion. For example:

```java
ImmutableList<String> abc = ImmutableList.of("a", "b", "c");

assertThat(abc).containsAllOf("c", "a", "b");             // passes
assertThat(abc).containsExactly("c", "a", "b");           // passes

assertThat(abc).containsAllOf("a", "b").inOrder();        // passes

assertThat(abc).containsAllOf("c", "a", "b").inOrder();   // fails
assertThat(abc).containsExactly("c", "a", "b").inOrder(); // fails
```

## Does it matter if I write `assertThat(a).isEqualTo(b)` or `assertThat(b).isEqualTo(a)`? {#order}

Yes! You should always be writing assertions in the form:

```java
assertThat(actualValue).isEqualTo(expectedValue);
```

In most cases, the **actual value** will be a call to the *code under test* and
the **expected value** will be a *literal value* or a *constant*. For example:

```java
assertThat(user.getId()).isEqualTo(42);      // literal value
assertThat(user.getId()).isEqualTo(USER_ID); // constant value
```

Please **do not** write the above assertion as
`assertThat(42).isEqualTo(user.getId())`.

Here's another example of two ways to write an assertion:

```java
assertThat(ImmutableList.of("red", "white", "blue")).contains(user.getFavoriteColor()); // BAD
assertThat(user.getFavoriteColor()).isAnyOf("red", "white", "blue");                    // GOOD
```

You should always use the latter instead of the former.

Any time you see a *literal value* or *constant* inside the `assertThat` call,
you should stop and try to write the *inverse assertion*.

## How do I compare floating point numbers with Truth? {#floating-point}

See the [floating point comparisons](comparison.md#floating-point). For example:

```java
assertThat(actualDouble).isWithin(tolerance).of(expectedDouble);
```

## How is this different than JUnit, Hamcrest, Fest, AssertJ, etc.?

See the [comparison](comparison.md) page.

## How do I write my own Truth subject for my own type?

See the [extension](extension.md) page.
